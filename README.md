# Nature-inspired-computation

Nature inspired computing, strives to develop new computing techniques through observing how naturally occurring phenomena behave to solve complex problems in various environmental situations. Some activities inspired by nature include ant colony, particle swarm, whales, genetics, etc. One of the most popular architectures Neural network is inspired by human brain activity using neuron signals. Hence these help us solve multiple real word problems with minimum computation.

## Knapsack problem

When we try to solve a selection problem containing multiple items is highly difficult by brut force. Hence, we use an evolutionary algorithm to solve this challenging task. 
In our problem, we need to select the best possible combination of bags to be filled in a security van that has a weight limit. To solve this we evolve the initial random population and the steps are as follows.
  1) Generate population
  2) Tournament selection
  3) Crossover 
  4) Mutation
  5) Fitness function
These steps for a given set of iterations will result in solutions optimal to solve the issue.
